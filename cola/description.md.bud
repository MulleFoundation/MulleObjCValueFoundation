These classes build on [MulleObjC](//github.com/mulle-objc/MulleObjC) and
[mulle-core](//github.com/mulle-core) to provide the usual
value classes expected in a Foundation library.

> A good distinction if a class is a value or a container is if it has a
> -count or a -length method. If it counts members with -length (number of
> bytes) it's a value.

There is no I/O in these classes. That is added by MulleObjcOSFoundation
and later libraries.
